What I uploaded was data I took from Fangraphs.com for a regression model to be made to predict the amount of home runs a player will hit.  

The data just has the data I took and the Rdata file is an updated dataframe I saved to use in my second Markdown notebook.  

My first R Markdown is some statistical analysis with the data and some problem solving on what I may want to do, all of the variables and everything is explained nicely with the graph and statistcis in the Markdown document.  

The second Markdown is my regression analysis and where I put my models togehter.  

I hope you enjoy and learn something new!
